# blinken-driver

This is a low level API for setting and getting the state of the LED array. For wiring details of our ceiling project, check out
[the wiring diagram](https://github.com/mattolson/blinken/blob/master/docs/panel_wiring.png). To adapt this project for your 
purposes (i.e. use a different physical layout), you'll need to change the Grid constructor.
